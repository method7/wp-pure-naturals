== Description ==

[<strong>Live Demo</strong>](https://demo.codewoogeek.online/back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce/)

<strong>Back In Stock Notifier</strong> is a WooCommerce Waitlist Pro Plugin which displays the Email Subscription form in frontend when a product is Out of Stock. When Product Back in Stock, this plugin will notifies the subscribers by email in a background process. Many of the existing plugins are loop through the subscribers to send mail so here there is many chance it will either fail/timeout. This plugin is designed to overcome this problem by sending a mail using background process, so that it will not fail till the completion of loop, by this you can turn your subscribers to customers.

== Supported Product Types of WooCommerce == 
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Variable</li>
<li>Grouped</li>
<li>Simple Subscription</li>
<li>Variable Subscription</li>
<li>Product Bundle(From WooCommerce)</li>
</ul>

We designed this product to manage subscribers in one place and what happen if we send instock mail for 10000+ subscribers, definitely server will crash or timeout issue/sometime duplicate mail to be sent to the subscribers.

We designed this plugin to overcome this situation by sending a mail in a background means asynchronous way so that mail will be sent to the respective user without any issue.
