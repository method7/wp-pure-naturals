== Shortcodes ==

To restrict content based on a user's CRM tags, wrap the desired content in the WP Fusion shortcode, like so:

`[wpf tag=45] Restricted Content [/wpf]`

You can also specify the tag name, like so:

`[wpf tag="New Customer"] Restricted Content [/wpf]`

To show content only if a user _doesn't_ have a certain tag, use the following syntax:

`[wpf not=45] Restricted Content [/wpf]`

To force an update of the current user's tags before loading the rest of the page, use:

`[wpf_update_tags]`

To force an update of the current user's meta data before loading the rest of the page, use:

`[wpf_update_meta]`
