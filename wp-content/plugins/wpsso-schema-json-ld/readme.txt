Google Rich Results and Structured Data for Articles, Carousels, Events, FAQ Pages, How-Tos, Local SEO, Products, Recipes, Ratings, Reviews, and More.

== Description ==

<p style="margin:0;"><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-schema-json-ld/assets/icon-256x256.png"></p>

**Supports over 495 different Schema types and sub-types:**

Google Rich Results and Structured Data for Articles, Carousels (aka Item Lists), Claim Reviews, Events, FAQ Pages, How-Tos, Images, Local Business / Local SEO, Organizations, Products, Ratings, Recipes, Restaurants, Reviews, Video Objects, and more.

**Reads your existing WordPress content, plugin and service API data:**

There's no need to manually re-create descriptions, titles, product information, re-select images / videos, etc.

This add-on provides accurate and comprehensive Schema JSON-LD markup for posts, pages, custom post types, terms (category, tags, etc.), custom taxonomies, user profile pages, search result pages, archive pages, and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) pages &mdash; including image SEO, video SEO, local business, organization, publisher, person, author and co-authors, extensive e-Commerce product markup, product variations, product ratings, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, collection pages, profile pages, search pages, FAQ pages, item lists for [Google's Carousel Rich Results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mark-up-listings), and much more.

**Most complete Schema JSON-LD markup for WooCommerce products:**

The WooCommerce plugin is known to offer incomplete Schema markup for Google. The <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO Core Premium plugin</a> (required for WooCommerce integration) and this add-on provide a far better solution by offering complete Facebook / Pinterest Product meta tags and Schema Product markup for Google Rich Results (aka Rich Snippets) &mdash; including additional product images, product variations, product information (brand, color, condition, dimensions, material, size, weight, SKU, GTIN-8/12/13/14, EAN, ISBN, MPN, etc), product reviews, product ratings, prices and currencies, sale start / end dates, sale prices, pre-tax prices, VAT prices, and much, much more.

**Fixes all Google Search Console / Structured Data Testing Tool errors:**

* A value for the headline field is required.
* A value for the image field is required.
* A value for the logo field is required.
* A value for the publisher field is required.
* The aggregateRating field is recommended.
* The brand field is recommended.
* The headline field is recommended.
* The image field is recommended.
* The mainEntityOfPage field is recommended.
* The review field is recommended.
* This Product is missing a global identifier (e.g. isbn, mpn or gtin8).
* No global identifier provided (e.g. gtin mpn isbn).
* Not a known valid target type for the itemReviewed property.
* And more...

Some Schema property values may require data from <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO Core Premium</a> supported 3rd party plugins and service APIs.

Google regularly updates and changes their Schema markup requirements - WPSSO JSON Premium customers can also <a href="https://surniaulula.com/support/">open a Premium support ticket for timely assistance</a> with any new Google testing tool errors.
